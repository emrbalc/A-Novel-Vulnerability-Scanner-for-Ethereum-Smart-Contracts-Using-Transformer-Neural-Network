In this repository, it has been worked on auditing Ethereum smart contracts using MAIAN tool which basically a smart contract audit tool that detects smart contracts in 3 different categories as suicidal, greedy and prodigal (https://github.com/ivicanikolicsg/MAIAN) and optimizing the time-wise performance of the audit using transformer neural network. The article on this topic will be published soon and will be added here.
You can find the description regarding repository files below;
1.	Smart Contract API Project: This project is an upgraded version of https://github.com/hoss-green/Etherscan.Net utilizing fetch and save operations of smart contracts.
2.	Thesis Py: This file contains operations of MAIAN analysis execeution for each smart contract file previously fetched using Smart Contract API Project.
3.	MAIAN Py: It is a version of the existing MAIAN file with the addition of saving smart contract analysis results to Excel.
4.	MAIAN Results: Excel file where analysis results in MAIAN Py are exported.
5.	Opcode Py: In this file, source code of smart contracts are converted opcode then exported to excel.
6.	Evm.mapping: Excel file with opcode equivalents of source codes.
7.	Opcode.xlsx: An excel file in which the hashes of the obtained smart contracts and the source codes of these smart contracts converted to opcode are matched.
