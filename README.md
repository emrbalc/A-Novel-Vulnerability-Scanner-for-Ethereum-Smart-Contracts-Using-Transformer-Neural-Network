**A Novel Vulnerability Scanner for Ethereum Smart Contracts Using Transformer Neural Network**

This is a research project that aims to develop a vulnerability scanner for Ethereum smart contracts using transformer neural network. The project is developed by Emre Balci as a part of his master's thesis at the [Department of Computer Engineering], Bahcesehir University.

**Introduction**

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. They are used to automate business processes and execute transactions in a decentralized and trustless manner. However, smart contracts are susceptible to security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to steal funds or disrupt the operation of the contract.

To address this problem, the research proposes a novel vulnerability scanner for Ethereum smart contracts using transformer neural network. The scanner analyzes the source codes of the smart contract and uses a transformer neural network to detect accuracy.

**Installation**

To use the vulnerability scanner, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.4.1 or higher
- Truffle 5.3.2 or higher
- Solidity 0.7.6 or higher

**Usage**

To use the vulnerability scanner, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Smart Contract API Project:** This project is an upgraded version of <https://github.com/hoss-green/Etherscan.Net> utilizing fetch and save operations of smart contracts.
1. **Thesis Py:** This file contains operations of MAIAN analysis execeution for each smart contract file previously fetched using Smart Contract API Project.
1. **MAIAN Py:** It is a version of the existing MAIAN file with the addition of saving smart contract analysis results to Excel.
1. **MAIAN Results**: Excel file where analysis results in MAIAN Py are exported.
1. **Opcode Py:** In this file, source code of smart contracts are converted opcode then exported to excel.
1. **Evm.mapping:** Excel file with opcode equivalents of source codes.
1. **Opcode.xlsx:** An excel file in which the hashes of the obtained smart contracts and the source codes of these smart contracts converted to opcode are matched.

The following command can be used to run the scanner:

**Results**

The vulnerability scanner has been tested on several smart contracts and has successfully detected vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow, and unhandled exceptions. The results of the experiments are presented in Emre Balci's master's thesis.

**Contributions**

Contributions to the vulnerability scanner are welcome. If you find a bug or want to suggest an improvement, please open an issue on this GitHub repository.
